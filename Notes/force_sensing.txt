This version includes force sensing. The shared_data structure includes a handle to the force sensor object titled g_ForceSensor. 
To acquire the forces or torques, write the following code:

	double forceData[3];
	int forceSensorData = sharedData.g_ForceSensor.AcquireFTData();
	sharedData.g_ForceSensor.GetForceReading(forceData);
	
	measuredForce[0] = forceData[0]; 
	measuredForce[1] = forceData[1]; 
	measuredForce[2] = forceData[2]; 
	
where measuredForce[0] --> X force
				   [1] --> Y force	
				   [2] --> Z force
				   

				   
To run the test harness for the force sensor, comment out the define for the main loop and uncomment the define for the
Force Sensor Test Main Loop.

The initialization of the force sensor takes place in the main function (file)
